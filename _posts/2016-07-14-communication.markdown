This is key - communication and managing expectations.

Watching interactions and frustrations in my last software customer success role, along with client expectations in building custom homes, I hold that in any business or personal interaction, communication and managing expectations is key.

Perhaps to a fault, I believe that clear written recaps of conversations, next steps and expectations from both parties in an interaction helps everyone to be on the same page. It's plain to see then if there is a difference of opinion in what happened and what's next.

Too many times I see interpretations of a conversation or what was to be done go awry and leads to frustration on both ends. So if I get the opportunity to work with you, I apologize in advance of my bullet point-ed emails and sentences about next steps. :)

But truly, I believe open and honest conversation early in any relationship will go a long, long, long way!

Thanks for listening....
