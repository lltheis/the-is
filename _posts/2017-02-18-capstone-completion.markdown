I've done it! Completed the [Software Product Management Specializationn](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/product-management){:target="_blank"} through the University of Alberta on Coursera. It's been a very valuable class for me, formalizing much of my learned knowledge through previous roles I've held. The wrap-up capstone project was a helpful project and transition in to how these skills we learned might be put in to place in to our work in the software world.

All in all, I truly see all projects as many variations on a theme, all requiring similar skills. From constructing a new home, to building a website, to planning a software release, to teaching a class to the community, to planning a software implementation - I think the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org){:target="_blank"} encompasses the spirit of what I strive for in any work. As a person who likes to plan and know what is going to happen and what the next steps are, the last one is one I must think about often.

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

As I move forward in my work at Knack, it's great to see so many of the [principles behind the Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html){:target="_blank"} already at work. I'm excited to also think about how the other tools I've learned in this class (reviews & metrics for software improvements, client needs and software requirements) might help us to put even better software out in to the world.
