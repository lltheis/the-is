I am so immensely thankful for the last two and half years that I spend with Local Food Marketplace. Both our team and our customers are amazing people doing amazing work and I had the opportunity to tie two of my passions together - food and technology. But late in 2015, as I looked toward the spring 'training' season with LFM, I found I was ready for more. After long chats with the team there, I've made the jump! I started my CareerFoundry web development course in March and wrapped up my time at LFM in April.

Now I'm in, up to my neck, in mountain lake freezing water. It's scary, it's invigorating and I love it! So many languages (which is best to learn - Ruby, JavaScript, .NET?), so many communities (StackOverflow, Google Groups, Reddit) and will I get hired (everyone wants a full stack, senior developer with 10+ years of experience)? So many choices, such a big industry and it feels like everyone is so far ahead of me. Yikes.

But....as I take each day as it comes, work on small, more manageable tasks, I'm finding that it is just like every mountain lake I jump in to - cold and shocking at first, but then, just take a moment to find calm, slow your breath, and make those first moves. Work through those first lessons, use other online coursework you can (Ruby Koans, CodeEval, Codacademy), start job searching, and start talking to anyone you can about what you're working on. The connections are coming - I'm making my way across that beautiful lake.  (Sorry for the cheesy comparison here, but this switch I've made really feels the same!)

Onward and across, one stroke at a time. A new experience and more to learn.

And thank you again, Amy, Doug, Jim, Ryan and all of the customers at Local Food Marketplace. What an excellent time I had with you all!
