I am SOOOOOOOOOO excited to announce that I've been offered (and I've accepted!) a customer success position at [Knack](https://www.knack.com/){:target="_blank"}. At Knack "we empower thousands of customers to do amazing things with their data". It's an online database company, with a software as a service product, where anyone can create their own database back to manage their data and then create live pages to use and display it. I've only just begun, but my co-workers are super smart and dedicated people.  And even though we are all remote, I feel like I know them well already! From what I've seen so far in my trial period for the job and first month of work, I know I'll be helping customers in a great diversity of businesses all over the world. There's so much room for growth and learning here at Knack.

It's been a long year of putting the pieces together with learning new skills, part-time work and job searching. I'm so grateful to have found Knack!
