Hi! I'm Laura.\\
I came by way of Wisconsin, through the University of Wisconsin-Madison, landscape architecture...\\
which led me to the [UW-Triathlon](http://www.wisconsintriathlon.org/){:target="_blank"} team...\\
which led me to guiding bike trips with [Trek Travel](http://trektravel.com/){:target="_blank"}...\\
which led me to the San Juan Islands, California wine country, and southern Utah...\\
which led me to want to live in the west...\\
which led me to an [AmeriCorps](http://www.nationalservice.gov/programs/americorps){:target="_blank"} position at the [ERC](http://www.ercsv.org/){:target="_blank"} in Ketchum, Idaho...\\
where the heck was Ketchum, Idaho?\\
a cross-country move to a place where I knew no one...\\
which led me to helping to found [Idahos Bounty](http://www.idahosbounty.coop){:target="_blank"} with my Americorps position...\\
where I worked from 2007-2013...\\
and I first ventured in to the software specs scene...\\
which led me to [Local Food Marketplace](http://home.localfoodmarketplace.com/){:target="_blank"}...\\
I dug in deeper to the software world,\\
support, training, bug testing, spec writing, documentation and more...\\
you know, full software development lifecycle stuff...\\
which brings me to today...\\
enrolled in [CareerFoundry](http://careerfoundry.com/){:target="_blank"}, working through [Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/){:target="_blank"}, [RubyKoans](http://rubykoans.com/){:target="_blank"} and other tools I can get my hands on.\\
Read more about my back story at [the-is.com](http://www.the-is.com).\\

I look forward to entering this big new world of with all of you!
