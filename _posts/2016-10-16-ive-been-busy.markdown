Yikes! It's been a while since my last post, but I've been wearing a few new hats and so have been settling in to those new things. 

Coming soon! ** *New website for scape design studio* **. I've put all the pieces together, thanks to [Scrivito Rails CMS](http://www.scrivito.com){:target="_blank"}. I am now working on adding content and finalizing layout. I'll be sure to let you all know when this is live.

New role! ** *Operations Manager for Creatives without Borders* **. Through my web developer class, I applied to an amazing organization, [Creatives without Borders](http://www.creativeswithoutborders.org){:target="_blank"}, that matches creatives (web designers, illustrators, graphic designers, etc.) with verified non-profits in need of some design assistance. I'm working with an excellent team at CWB and can't wait to see the leaps and bounds the team makes this coming year! This is a part-time, volunteer position for me.

New class! ** *Software Product Management Specialization* **. In order to solidify some of my on-the-job experiences, I am taking a course through the University of Alberta called [Software Product Management Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/product-management){:target="_blank"}. I'm through the first few sections and it's really great to be able to put names to some of the techniques I've used throughout my work. I'm looking forward to learning Agile best practices more solidly and take on a capstone project in January.

New class! ** *SQL Essential Training* **. Database set up and management is at the root of any website application and after learning some basics in my CareerFoundry web developer course, I want to continue to build on this vast piece of web application development with the [SQL Essential Training course](https://www.lynda.com/SQL-tutorials/SQL-Essential-Training/139988-2.html){:target="_blank"} through Lynda. Stay tuned; I'm sure there will be much more work in this area in the future!

Thanks for listening and feel free to reach out anytime,
Laura
