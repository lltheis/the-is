I've been tasked by an employer to get a website launched online. In a past iteration, we put together a Squarespace site using their excellent tools.

But......a layout that is "the one" has been discovered and I think with my new found tools learned through my classwork at [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/){:target="_blank"}, I'm ready. Here's the plan: 

* research online Rails CMS services and find [RefineryCMS](http://www.refinerycms.com/){:target="_blank"} (great developer community and documentation) this leads to requirements of > 
* [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/){:target="_blank"} / Amazon S3 (for image hosting)

All is coming along swimmingly (well, a VERY slow swim, but I'm getting over those waves) until > 

* I hit a hard brick wall in building this site with some of the Heroku server errors, the dreaded [(R14 Memory Quota Exceeded in Ruby)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ruby-memory-use){:target="_blank"} error. I spend hours of time researching and troubleshooting this error, but the caching, image storage, etc. etc. is just above my skill level so far in this big new world of development.

So I do some more research - 
a. Would another hosting service help? Perhaps, but most I found are paid services and still require a CMS integration
b. I find [Scrivito](https://scrivito.com/){:target="_blank"} - it seems like the perfect solution and I'm able to get the site up and hosted there, but authentication and my exact set up of being able to enter project information has left me still struggling.
c. Should a website profession take this over? Better implementation, know the latest tricks and tools and long-term support.

As a student new to all this, I'm pretty frustrated with myself that I just can't get it to work! But, I'm so amazed by all the support the development community provides for each other, the super cool tools that are out there and most of all the great behind-the-scenes work that goes in to all the websites we use daily an mostly likely, take for granted. After all the hours and hours of implementation and learning I've put in, I'm leaning toward option C - mostly due to the long-term support this website would get from a website professional. I don't think I'll end up working with a website design firm so don't want to leave this one website hanging, but who knows....

Happy learning!
