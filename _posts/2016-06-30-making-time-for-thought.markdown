This "break in the action" is the first I've had in quite some time. It's my nature (I get it from my mom!), to work hard and fill my time when I'm not working with workouts, family and friends.

But since my work has been scaled back and class-time is on my own, it's leaving me some space that I haven't had in many moons to take a breath between tasks and leave some space for thought.

So, I'm putting it down here for the record, that whatever my next iteration of my career looks like, that I'll aim to maintain this space for thought each day - space to think problems through, look around and find a creative solution to that problem you haven't been able to solve.

I've also embarked on a project through the great podcast [Note to Self](http://www.wnyc.org/shows/notetoself){:target="_blank"} called [Infomagical](http://project.wnyc.org/infomagical){:target="_blank"}. I've chosen the goal of 'be more creative' and I think this goes hand in hand with this space for thought. If there's no time to just be, just think, the opportunity is not the to allow for creativity.

I'm astounded by the information they provided about 'multi-tasking' and how terribly long it takes you to get back to your original task.  So that's my aim, do each task until it's at a good stopping point. In other words, not to be distracted by the new email message that just came in while you were looking something up or the text message that just came in. Hopefully by being more productive in doing one task at a time, I'll be able to more easily allow for my time for thought.

How do you build in this time for thought in to your own life?
