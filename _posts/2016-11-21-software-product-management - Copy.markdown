I just wanted to pop in for a brief moment and write about the class I've started taking through the University of Alberta called [Software Product Management Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/product-management){:target="_blank"}. Their course is fabulously put together and it's really been great leaning official methods language around many of the steps we took at Local Food Marketplace around software planning and releases. Looking forward to the "Reviews & Metrics for Software Improvements" section coming up soon.

It seems like a lot of Agile is just common sense spelled out in a usable way. And I just listened to this the other day - Agile methods put in use in 'real' life!  [Note to Self. Programming Families: How kids are Like Software, and What the Government Could Learn From It](http://www.wnyc.org/story/programming-families-how-kids-like-software-what-the-government-could-learn){:target="_blank"}.

That's all for now!
