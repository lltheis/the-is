My oh my! If you were to look at the time between my last post here and now, you'd have thought I had fallen off the face of the earth! Luckily, I've just been focusing my energies on a couple of other classes and digging in deep to product world and technical support work at [Knack](http://knack.com).

Here's what Ive been up to:

* [Codecademy / Pro Intensive: Build Web APIs from Scratch](https://help.codecademy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002186253-What-curriculum-is-covered-in-Build-Web-APIs-From-Scratch-?aad=aWxoaTFlTnpBK0NBYlJMOXh1dGp0SWNrdFplRGFZRTRUUUZLSVNsMDlMR1h1NWFNS0hTWE1BRWVTSENKCks4YjNLYUR4NUpKSnNORjQvVWJ5OVMxL2xScGpQNGlZaG4wN2ZUWXJhcGs5UU1Kd1lnU0MxKzFSd2Y0SgpLZzdqcStrazZoY2NROThwcGpXcm1NTkNhZzdZK3REb3AvcFltbTZuOHdNUFFuK3h4L1ZqVmhzZEZ4TTYKOGt3TEVuZTdGTUNyOW5NS2U0Q3M4dG5LNkxoRjZUQXBQQT09): I thoroughly enjoyed the content of this course and the links it put together in my mind with how the back-end of an app interacts with a database and how APIs are making calls. It was a illustrative exercise for me in the code that the engineering team at Knack puts together.
* [CareerFoundry UX Design](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-ux-designer): I'm halfway done with this amazing course! I cannot speak highly enough about the courses and team CareerFoundry has created. So far I've created the UX Fundamentals course and going from start to finish on a design for a vocabulary app. Now, I'm halfway through a deep dive in design an Expert app (enabling anyone, anywhere to chat with an expert in virtually any field). So far they've covered Thinking Like a UXer, Understanding the User and Foundational Design.

I'll be sure to get my portfolio up on the site here!

Hope things are great with you all -
