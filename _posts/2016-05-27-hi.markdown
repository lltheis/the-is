Hi! I'm Laura.\\
It's just me and I'm here.\\
I came by way of Wisconsin, through the University of Wisconsin-Madison, landscape architecture...\\
which led me to the [UW-Triathlon][uw-triathlon] team...\\
which led me to guiding bike trips with [Trek Travel][trek-travel]...\\
which led me to the San Juan Islands, California wine country, and southern Utah...\\
which led me to want to live in the west...\\
which led me to an [Americorps][americorps] position at the [ERC][erc] in Ketchum, Idaho...\\
where the heck was Ketchum, Idaho?\\
a cross-country move to a place I knew no one...\\
which led me to helping to found [Idaho's Bounty Co-op][idahos-bounty] with my Americorps position...\\
where I worked from 2007-2013...\\
and I first ventured in to the software specs scene...\\
which led me to [Local Food Marketplace][local-food-marketplace]...\\
I dug in deeper to the software world,\\
support, training, bug testing, spec writing, documentation and more...\\
you know, full software development lifecycle stuff...\\
which brings me to today...\\
enrolled in CareerFoundry, working through Ruby The Hard Way, RubyKoans and other tools I can get my hands on.\\

I look forward to entering this big new world of with all of you!
